## How to: Perfom a Release

* Launch in dry run mode  :

```bash
# It should be SECRETHUB_ORG=graviteeio, but Cirlce CI token is related to
# a Circle CI User, not an Org, so just reusing the same than for Gravtiee-Lab here, to work faster
# ---
SECRETHUB_ORG=gravitee-lab
SECRETHUB_REPO=cicd
# Nevertheless, I today think :
# Each team member should have his own personal secrethub repo in the [graviteeio] secrethub org.
# like this :
# a [graviteeio/${TEAM_MEMBER_NAME}] secrethub repo for each team member
# and the Circle CI Personal Access token stored with [graviteeio/${TEAM_MEMBER_NAME}/circleci/token]
# ---
