# From the Gitops View, Comparing Gravitee on the Market : Rocket-pushing gravitee on the market

Here I will end up comparing Gravitee with other palyers of the market, from the Gitops Point of view :
* Especially from thge CRDs point of view
* Series of questiosn to compare products :
  * Do they have CRDs ?
  * If they have CRDs, what can a gitops do with those CRDs ?
  * Mesh pattern and API Gateways, what  ?


The `CRD` point of view is telling so much about all of those compared products.
