## Misc preliminary actions

### Allure Framework for QAs

* https://github.com/allure-framework/allure2/issues/1206 :
  * And I sent a request for free trial, via the website dedicated form, that will be for evaluation, https://qameta.io/
  * then I also sent a request for pro support, to get the best SAAS offers asap for project https://qameta.io/we-need-bespoke-solution/

Ok so on Allure, I :
* made a Circle CI QA Workflow running during the release process : to have a QA dedicated Workflow
* made static dashboard with Gravitee AM, based on test results located in `tests-surefire` folders of each maven multi module


### Next step : SonarCloud.io / Circle CI
