overview_desc: This guide walks you through creating your first application and subscribing to your first API with APIM Portal. For a brief overview of how to set up your first API, see the <strong>Publish your first API</strong> section of the Quick Start Guide.
overview_infos:   APIM includes several ways to access and secure an API, as described in ([API Publisher Plans and subscriptions](/apim/3.x/apim_publisherguide_plans_subscriptions.html)).
                  In this example, we will access an API using an <a href="/apim/3.x/apim_policies_apikey.html">API Key</a>.
                  Only trusted applications can access the API data by requesting an API Key.
                  Letâ€™s see how to create an application and generate an API Key.
