# The infrastructure of the CICD System


In this part, I will :
* Inventory the whole infrastructure used by the CICD System
* For each infrastructure component :
  * document the role of the componentin the Global CICD System, and in Which CICD Processes it is involved, and eventually criticial.
  * document every standard and non standard operations
  * when we at gravitee designed provision the component: document the design of the provisioning recipe. (e.g. : Artifactory is not provisioned by the gravitee team, but clever cloud, it's saas. The Zip bundles Http serer on the other hand is)
