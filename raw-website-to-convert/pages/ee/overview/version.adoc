== Versions

When subscribing to support services provided by GraviteeSource, you have to make a choice between two kind of version:

* STS for Short-Term Support
* LTS for Long-Term Support

LTS are versions which are ending by 0 or 5, for example: 1.25, 1.30, 1.35, ...
STS are ... all non-LTS versions.

A LTS version is supported for around 1 year whereas a STS version is supported for 3 months.

When moving to an Enterprise version, there is no such choice: all the LTS versions are de-facto Enterprise versions.

What does it mean for you? I would say nothing, just that you're ensured that you are running the most well-tested and
production-ready versions.
