OAuth 2.0 defines standard grant types for the token endpoint, such as _password_, _authorization_code_ and _refresh_token_.

Extension grants are a way to add support for non-standard token issuance scenarios like token exchange, delegation, or
custom credentials.

Gravitee.io Access Management allows you to extend available grants for an application by adding custom extension grant.
